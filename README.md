## ToDo

- Add streaks (like 3 in a row gets you a multiplier)
- Release somewhere
- Refactor + TypeScript
- Try to normalize songs (strip everything after "-" remove "(" and other special chars)
- Speech-to-guess, is it possible? Can we listen and detect what the fuck people are saying? Maybe
- Practice rounds (no leaderboard)
- Tell how fast they answered
- Handicap for people
